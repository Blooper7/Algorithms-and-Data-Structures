# Algorithms and Data Structures
Algorithms and data structures implemented in C and Python
## Why the heck are you doing this?
I'm doing this to practice making fundamental data structures and algorithms to strengthen my grip on using laguages to create said algorithms and structures, as well as how and when to use them.
(Also to get me a job :D)
